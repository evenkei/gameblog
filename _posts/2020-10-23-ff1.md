I'm working on an old school JRPG in [OHRRPGCE](https://rpg.hamsterrepublic.com/ohrrpgce/Main_Page) and I decided to check out the original Final Fantasy for fun and research. Growing up, I thought of the Playstation era as peak FF, although at this point I've also played some or all of 4,6,10, and 13. I've just sparkled up the Earth ORB (1/4)!

Notes about my play experience:
I've been trying to abide by the limitations that I think will create the most interesting experience, while skipping over tedium that would get me to check out entirely.
