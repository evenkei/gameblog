I'm working on an old school JRPG in [OHRRPGCE](https://rpg.hamsterrepublic.com/ohrrpgce/Main_Page) and I decided to check out the original Final Fantasy for fun and research. Growing up, I thought of the Playstation era as peak FF, although at this point I've also played some or all of 4,6,10, and 13. I've just sparkled up the Earth ORB (1/4)!

Notes about my play experience:
I've been trying to abide by the limitations that I think will create the most interesting experience for me, while skipping over tedium that would get me to check out entirely. 
Anachronous decisions:
* **Speeding up gameplay using emulator turbo button.** It's not ideal because the music speeds up and it breaks the game's rhythm. Future editions do stuff like add a dash button which I think is a pretty harmless upgrade. I also wish you could do things like buy multiple healing items at once (especially since I go through these like water).
* **Rewind time.** Mesen allows you to go back to earlier points in your play session. I prefer this to using lots of save slots pre-emptively because it's less disruptive to the game's rhythm. But if there's a setback that's too demoralizing then I can also just... pretend it never happened.
* **Using [guides](https://guides.gamercorner.net/ff/spells/) for info on spells and equipment**. The NES version of the game has tons of bugs in the spells that cause them to not work or not make sense. And it's a logistical nightmare trying to understand the weapons and armor from in-game info due to the inconvenient menus.

Synchronous decisions:
* I'm playing the NES version rather than the remakes. My thinking is that I'm interested in the game as an intentional object created under certain circumstances with certain goals. From a graphics standpoint, the PS1 and GBA remakes are both very bizarre to me. Devoid of context, they are appealing enough, with the GBA graphics being particularly round and cute in a way that probably would have appealed to me a lot as a kid. But they really bring a different energy, casting a sort of lush cartoon finish on the game. Which feels very incongruous to me, because
