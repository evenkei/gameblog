I'm working on an old school JRPG in [OHRRPGCE](https://rpg.hamsterrepublic.com/ohrrpgce/Main_Page) and I decided to check out the original Final Fantasy for fun and research. Growing up, I thought of the Playstation era as peak FF, although at this point I've also played some or all of 4,6,10, and 13. I've just sparkled up the Earth ORB (1/4)!

Notes about my play experience:
I've been trying to abide by the limitations that I think will create the most interesting experience, while skipping over tedium that would get me to check out entirely. 
Anachronous decisions:
* I've been speeding up gameplay using the turbo button. It's not ideal because the music speeds up and it's distracting to constantly be making micro-decisions in the back of my mind about it. Future editions do stuff like add a dash button which I think is a pretty harmless upgrade. I also wish you could do things like buy multiple healing items at once (especially since I go through these like water).
* If I make a terrible mistake deep in a dungeon I will rewind time. The emulator I'm playing on (Mesen) allows you to go back to earlier points in your play session. I prefer this to using lots of save slots pre-emptively because it's less distracting from the game's rhythm. But if there's a setback that's so demoralizing that I'd just quit then I can also just... pretend it never happened.
