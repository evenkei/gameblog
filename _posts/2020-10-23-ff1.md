I'm working on an old school JRPG in [OHRRPGCE](https://rpg.hamsterrepublic.com/ohrrpgce/Main_Page) and I decided to check out the original Final Fantasy for fun and research. Growing up, I thought of the Playstation era as peak FF, although at this point I've also played some or all of 4,6,10, and 13.
