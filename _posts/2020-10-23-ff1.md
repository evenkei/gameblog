I'm working on an old school JRPG in [OHRRPGCE](https://rpg.hamsterrepublic.com/ohrrpgce/Main_Page) and I decided to check out the original Final Fantasy for fun and research. Growing up, I thought of the Playstation era as peak FF, although at this point I've also played some or all of 4,6,10, and 13. I've just sparkled up the Earth ORB (1/4)!

Notes about my play experience:
I've been trying to abide by the limitations that I think will create the most interesting experience for me, while skipping over tedium that would get me to check out entirely. 

# Anachronous decisions:
* **Speeding up gameplay using emulator turbo button.** It's not ideal because the music speeds up and it breaks the game's rhythm. Future editions do stuff like add a dash button which I think is a pretty harmless upgrade. I also wish you could do things like buy multiple healing items at once (especially since I go through these like water).
* **Rewind time.** Mesen allows you to go back to earlier points in your play session. I prefer this to using lots of save slots pre-emptively because it's less disruptive to the game's rhythm. But if there's a setback that's too demoralizing then I can still just... pretend it never happened ;)
* **Using [guides](https://guides.gamercorner.net/ff/spells/) for info on spells and equipment**. The NES version of the game has tons of bugs in the spells that cause them to not work or not make sense. And it's a logistical nightmare trying to understand the weapons and armor from in-game info due to the inconvenient menus.

## Synchronous decisions:
* I'm playing the NES version rather than the remakes. My thinking is that I'm interested in the game as an intentional object created under certain circumstances with certain goals. From a graphics standpoint, the PS1 and GBA remakes both feel strange to me. Devoid of context, they are appealing enough, with the GBA graphics being particularly round and cute in a way that I probably would have preferred as a kid. But they really bring a different energy, casting a sort of lush cartoon finish on the game. Which feels very incongruous to the game's sparse and tense structure. The original sprites are quite frankly scary, bristling with scratchy, ambiguous detail. The backgrounds evoke their physical locations with small and surprisingly beautiful strips of art, but the battle screen is an abstraction, a menu, first and foremost. I'm often shocked and relieved when I beat bosses on the first or second try, because the game has so successfully built up tension. So much of this game lives in your mind, and the heavy abstraction supports this. I can't help but think that prettifying the game would make it feel more boring and empty, because it's priming your brain for the wrong type of experience. 
	* Additionally, the GBA version changes the magic system from the DnD-style level-based spell slots of the original to a shared MP pool like later FF games. It's a similar move to the graphical changes in that it smooths and modernizes the systems in ways I find incongruous. I was actually really enjoying how the spell slots system diminishes the problem that later FF games have where early game spells are rendered almost completely obsolete. By having reserved slots for low-level spells, you can use them "guilt free" because they don't take the same resource as your powerful newer abilities. 
* **Avoiding heavy reliance on external maps.** Much of the drama comes from the guesses, hopes, disappointments, and relief that happens as you navigate the maps. I don't think that using walkthroughs in general is like "bad". But there's kind of just not much left over to experience if you do that here, and it's worth attempting to trust that this game will create interesting drama out of your ignorance.

## Overall Impressions:
It's very inspiring for a lot of the reasons that I touched on
